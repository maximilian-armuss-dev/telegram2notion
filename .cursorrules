# 🌟 Project Guidelines & Code Style 🌟

This document defines the rules and preferred style for code generation within this project.

## 🚀 Technology Stack 🚀

*   **Python:** Version 3.11+ is used.
*   **FastAPI:** For the implementation of API endpoints.
*   **Docker & Docker Compose:** For containerization of the application.

## 📚 Core Libraries 📚

*   `langchain-google-genai`: For interaction with the Gemini model.
*   `python-telegram-bot`: The official SDK for the Telegram Bot API.
*   `notion-client`: The official SDK for the Notion API.
*   `pydantic-settings`: For managing environment variables.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Code Style 🏗️

*   The code must be **modular** and follow the principle of **Separation of Concerns**.
*   Create a dedicated service in the `/app/services` directory for each external API.
*   Always prefer using official SDKs (like `python-telegram-bot` or `notion-client`) over direct HTTP requests with `httpx` or `requests`.
*   Use the `logging` module for all informational output, warnings, and errors. The `print()` function must **never** be used.
*   All configuration values and credentials must be loaded from the `.env` file via `config.py`. Hardcoded keys in the source code are **not** allowed.
*   The main workflow is orchestrated in `app/processing/workflow_processor.py`.
*   The application's entry point is `app/main.py`.

## 📝 Prompts 📝

*   The central prompt for the LLM is located in `/prompts/main_prompt.txt`.
*   When modifying logic that involves the LLM, always refer to this file and its placeholders (`[[SCHEMA PLACEHOLDER]]`, `[[TEXT PLACEHOLDER]]`).
